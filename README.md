# Task Completed

Finally! I got everything on my landing page just where I wanted it to be.
All thanks to CSS flex box.

Basically, this landing page has 4 sections and a footer. It took me a whole day (I took breaks) to complete this task.

# What Did I build?
This isn't looking pixel perfect or as cool as Facebook but I still love it. I love the process.


- First section: I have a Nav bar and a Hero Section
- Seond section: I have 4 cards that shows up some random information
- Third section: Thor stopped by and dropped a quote, so I added it there.
- Fourth section: I added a call to action so customers can quickly get in touch.
- Footer: Shout out to TOP, I have a credit note here "Copyright Â© The Odin Project"



# What Did I Learn?

- Google is life saver. I'm learning how to Google better. 
- While taking the CSS Foundation on TOP, I tought I understood the concepts being explained, but when I decided to get my hands dirty, it dawned on me that "Winter has come" lol
- I think I've learnt to appreciate CSS for what it is.
